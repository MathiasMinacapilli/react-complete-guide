The difference between state (in a class that extends Component) with React Hooks is that when you update the state using the attribute state, the setState method to be more specific, the data in the state is going to be merged with the data that you are setting now with the method setState. On the other hand, using React Hooks, when you update the state this is going to be replaced with the old state, so you have to be carefully when you update the state while using React Hooks to not loose any of the information of the previous state.
